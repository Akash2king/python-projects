# FLAMES Calculator

This Python script calculates the FLAMES relationship compatibility between two people based on their names. FLAMES is an acronym that stands for "Friendship," "Love," "Affection," "Marriage," "Enemies," and "Sister."

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the script on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Python installed on your machine. If you don't have it installed, you can download it from the official website: [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Akash2king/python-projects/blob/a6f3a147290227394db5d3c49551db9fd3a65d5a/FLAMES/flames-calculator.py
   ```

2. Navigate to the cloned repository directory:

   ```
   cd flames-calculator
   ```

3. Run the script:

   ```
   python flames_calculator.py
   ```

4. Enter the names of the boy and girl without spaces as prompted.

5. The script will calculate the FLAMES compatibility and display the result.

### How it Works

The FLAMES calculation involves the following steps:

1. Seperating the names to count the number of characters that are not common in both names.
2. Iterating through the FLAMES acronym list and removing the corresponding letter for each iteration until only one letter remains, representing the final relationship category.
