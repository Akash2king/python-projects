Hey there, fellow code enthusiast! Welcome to my Python projects playground! 🎉 This is where I let my coding creativity run wild and tinker with all sorts of fun Python stuff. Dive in, explore, and join the coding party! 🎈

# What's Cookin'? 🍳

In this repository, you'll find a delightful assortment of Python projects, each with its own quirks and surprises. From games that make you go "aha!" to nifty utilities that save the day, there's something here for every Pythonista. 🎈

### Prerequisites

You need to have Python installed on your machine. If you don't have it installed, you can download it from the official website: [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Feast Your Eyes on These Treats 🍰

Here are a couple of the juicy projects you can nibble on:

- [🔮 Guess the Number](https://github.com/Akash2king/python-projects/tree/7bf6dfb0d4a604a89429abbe9c8ff652437acf14/Guss_the_number): A number-guessing game that's got a sprinkle of randomness and a dash of excitement!
- [💞 Flames]( https://github.com/Akash2king/python-projects/tree/7c9cab64265129bea33ed314e61b5b920bd7c2a3/FLAMES): This Python script calculates the FLAMES relationship compatibility between two people based on their names. FLAMES is an acronym that stands for "Friendship," "Love," "Affection," "Marriage," "Enemies," and "Sister."
- [📋 Text Data Extractor](https://github.com/Akash2king/python-projects/tree/7bf6dfb0d4a604a89429abbe9c8ff652437acf14/File_regex): This Python script extracts specific data (emails, URLs, and phone numbers) from a given text file and writes them to separate output files.
- [💾Web_source_code_extractor](Web_source_code_extractor) :
Python script to fetch and save web page source code. Display and save options available. Contributions welcome. 
- [📁File Organizer Program](https://github.com/Akash2king/python-projects/tree/88a247836b373b0965774a1a16b4ece3378bc677/File%20organizor) :
This Python program organizes files into different directories based on their types. It helps keep your files more organized by moving them to appropriate folders.
Don't just read about them – fire up your terminal and give 'em a whirl! 🚀

## Ready to Join the Party? 🎈

To jump into the coding fiesta:

1. Clone this repository like a pro.
2. Tap-dance your way into the project's directory using the command line.
3. Fire up the Python script that tickles your fancy. Like so: `python Guss_the_number/guss_the_number.py`

Make sure you've got Python installed or this bash won't be a bash! 🎉
