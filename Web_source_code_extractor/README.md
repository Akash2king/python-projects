# Web Source Code Extractor

This Python script allows you to extract the source code of a web page from a given URL and optionally save it to a file. It uses the `requests` library for fetching web content and `re` (regular expressions) for processing URLs and extracting filenames.

## Features

- Fetches source code from a provided URL
- Saves the source code as an HTML file (optional)
- Option to display the extracted source code

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the `web_code_extractor.py` file.
2. Run the script using your Python interpreter.
3. Provide a URL when prompted.
4. Choose whether to save the source code as a file or not.
5. Optionally choose to display the extracted source code.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- The `requests` library (you can install it using `pip install requests`)

## Usage Example

```bash
$ python web_code_extractor.py
Enter the URL: https://example.com
Do you want to store it in a file (y/n): y
File 'example.html' written successfully!
Do you want to display it (y/n): y

```
