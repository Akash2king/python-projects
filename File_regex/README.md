# Text Data Extractor

This Python script extracts specific data (emails, URLs, and phone numbers) from a given text file and writes them to separate output files.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you run the script on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Python installed on your machine. If you don't have it installed, you can download it from the official website: [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Akash2king/python-projects/blob/11b54c7a702900460b7beda4f448d0d14974edb2/File_regex/File_regex.py
   ```

2. Navigate to the cloned repository directory:
   
   ```
   cd text-data-extractor
   ```

3. Place the text file from which you want to extract data in the same directory as the script. Make sure to replace `"SOURCE FILE YOU WANT TO EXTRACT FROM.txt"` with your actual source file's name.

4. Open a terminal in the repository directory and run the script:

   ```
   python text_data_extractor.py
   ```

5. The script will prompt you to choose the type of data you want to extract: URLs, emails, or phone numbers. Enter the corresponding number to proceed.

6. The extracted data will be written to separate output files. Make sure to replace `"TARGET FILE PATH YOU WANT TO CREATE.txt"` with the desired output file path.

7. After extracting the data, the script will ask if you want to extract another type of data. Enter 'y' for yes or 'n' for no.

8. Once you're done, the script will display a "thank you" message.
